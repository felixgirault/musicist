# Musicist

An simple app to practice musical scales.
[musicist.fglt.fr](https://musicist.fglt.fr/)

Musicist allows you to visualize and interact with musical scales
on various instruments.

Instruments can be played with a mouse, touch gestures, or via
plugged-in MIDI devices.

Selecting a scale will highlight relevant notes on your
instrument of choice, even suggesting fingerings for fretted
instruments!

## Roadmap

As this was put together in a short time for a hackathon, there
is still much room for improvement:

-  [ ] Improving accessibility
-  [ ] Improving fingering suggestion
   -  [ ] Allowing selection of a preferred fretboard zone
   -  [ ] Handling edge cases where the fingering could be more
          comfortable
-  [ ] Suggesting scales by analyzing played notes
-  [ ] Improving devices support (for now, the app is mostly
       optimized for small mobile devices in landscape
       orientation)
-  [ ] Improving in-app documentation/affordance
-  [ ] Adding translations
